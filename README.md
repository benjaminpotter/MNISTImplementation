# MNIST Implementation
This project was made for Queen's University APSC 103. It is capable of recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning in Python and the MNIST dataset.

## Starting the Application

### `npm run front`
This will start the react development server. The app should automatically open in a new tab.

### `npm run back`
This will start the python prediction API. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Dependencies below).

ReactJS and NodeJS are required to run the front end app.
Python requires Tensorflow, Pickle, Flask and others. See website/src/predictor/main.py for more information.
